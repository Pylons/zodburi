``zodburi`` Changelog
=====================

2.0 (2014-01-05)
----------------

- Update ``ZODB3`` meta-package dependency to ``ZODB`` + ``ZConfig`` + ``ZEO``.
  Those releases are what we import, and have final Py3k-compatible releases.

2.0b1 (2013-05-02)
------------------

- Added support for Python 3.2 / 3.3.

- Added ``setup.py docs`` alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` and installs
  documentation dependencies).

- Added ``setup.py dev`` alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` and installs
  testing dependencies).

- Automated building the Sphinx docs via ``tox``.

- Fixed 'zconfig:' URIs under Python 2.7.  The code worked around a bug in
  the stdlib's 'urlparse.urlsplit' for Python < 2.7; that workaround broke
  under 2.7.  See https://github.com/Pylons/zodburi/issues/5

- Dropped support for Python 2.5.

1.1 (2012-09-12)

  the patch!
