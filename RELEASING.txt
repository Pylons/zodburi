========================
 Making zodburi release
========================

To make a next release, by default, command ``fullrelease`` from
`zest.releaser`__ works fine. It will go through to update version number,
changelog, commit and tag those changes, upload the package to PyPI, and to
further switch the source tree for the next development cycle.

If/when needed, one could manually make all the steps described above.
See `Packaging Python Projects`__ and zodburi git history for details.
