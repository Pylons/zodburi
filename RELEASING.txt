We use zest.releaser for release automation.

https://pypi.org/project/zest.releaser/

To make a new release, first prepare by adding any omitted entries to
CHANGES.rst. Then use the following command, accepting all default options:

    fullrelease

It will go through to update version number, changelog, commit and tag those
changes, upload the package to PyPI, and to further switch the source tree for
the next development cycle.

See zest.releaser documentation for details:

https://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#available-commands


If needed, one could instead manually make all release steps described above.
